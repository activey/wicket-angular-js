=================

Apache Wicket wrappers around AngularJS - write Angular using Wicket only :)

For interested parties - this code is just an experiment, a Proof of Concept, but hey, it works ;) If you'd like to help me out with that by forking it and doing any code changes/fixes/new contributions - feel free to fork it and create a pull request. Will make my best to review it as soon as possible. Please keep in mind that there are no unit tests or anything that could prove it works out of the box. You could encounter some nasty code fragments like printing stack traces directly to system output or inline string contants ;) It has to be fixed eventually. Also class packaging is totally temporary and it needs to be changed as well.

I'm aming to keep it as simple as possible giving a developer almost 100% of AngularJS features while sticking to Java and Wicket code only using as little JS code as possible.
